• Self Learning project implemented to understand graph’s application in real world scenarios. 
• Manual Creation of Graph using Metro Stations as Nodes and estimated distance among them as Edges is done. 
• Leveraged Dijkstra Algorithm and Heaps in order to simulate distances between Metro Stations cost/time wise


##  REQUIREMENTS

> The project can run on any online or offline Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, Netbeans, ideone.com, etc.
> You should have at least elementary knowledge of Java Programming language to work on the project.
> Knowledge of data structures like Graph and Heap and Algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, etc is appreciated, however, it is not essential.
> And lastly, some understanding of the Collection framework makes it a cakewalk journey. (If you don't know about the Collection framework it is not a                   problem, you can proceed without it and while working if you feel the need to know you can refer to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/ ).


## That was all... You are all set to work on the project!!!!
